# mkdir

An old web browser feature [1][2] that got lost to time is the ability for the user to edit documents right inside the browser.

This extension, `mkdir`, adds a button to the tool bar that will create a directory under a user-specified name at the current location from the origin server using a HTTP MKCOL request.

# Installation

Go to chrome://extensions, enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner and then load the extension using the "Load unpacked" button.
Then click on the "extensions" button in the tool bar (it looks like a puzzle piece) and pin the `mkdir` extension to the toolbar by clicking on the pin.
